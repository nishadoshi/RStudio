Using machine learning models to analyze our data to then pull out some conclusions.

1. Decision Tree

data <- sleep_and_lifestyle %>%
  select(Sleep.Disorder, Gender, Age, Sleep.Duration, Quality.of.Sleep, Physical.Activity.Level, Stress.Level, BMI.Category, Heart.Rate) %>% 
na.omit()

data <- data %>%
  mutate_all(as.factor)

form_full<- as.formula(Sleep.Disorder~ Gender + Age + Sleep.Duration + Quality.of.Sleep + Physical.Activity.Level + Stress.Level + BMI.Category + Heart.Rate)

mod_tree1 <- rpart(form_full, data = train1)
rpart.plot(mod_tree1)


calculating confusion matrix and misclass rate 
confusion_matrix <- train1 %>% 
  mutate(pred3 = predict(mod_tree1, type = "class")) %>%
  select(Sleep.Disorder, pred3) %>% table()
confusion_matrix
##               pred3
## Sleep.Disorder Insomnia None Sleep Apnea
##    Insomnia          52   11           0
##    None               4  162           6
##    Sleep Apnea        1   13          50
misclass_rate = 1 - sum(diag(confusion_matrix))/sum(confusion_matrix)
misclass_rate
## [1] 0.1170569

Analysis: 
56% of individuals in the training set have normal or normal weight BMI and no sleep disorder. 
Whereas, 44% of individuals that do not have a normal or normal weight BMI have sleep apnea. 
The next node splits on whether physical activity level is greater than or less than 70 minutes/day. 
19% of individuals that do not have normal or normal weight BMI and exercise more than 70 minutes/day have sleep apnea. 
Of those in the training set who exercise more than 70 minutes/day and do not have a normal or normal weight BMI, 25% have insomnia. 
Of individuals who exercise more than 70 minutes/day and do not have a normal or normal weight BMI, 19% of those younger than 43 years old have insomnia and 6% of those 43 years old or older have no sleep disorder. 
Misclassification error rate is 0.1170569.
